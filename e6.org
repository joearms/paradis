* Error and Distributed Programming 
** Chapters 13,14. 
** Links.
** Monitors.
** The error model.
** Firewall.
** Generic Allocator.
** Why Distributed Programming?
** Erlang distribution.
** Explicit sockets and protocols.
** Distribution BIFS.
** Nano-twitter.
** Security.


* Links
  
** When an unlinked process dies nobody will know about it.
** When a linked process dies the processes in the link-set of the process will be sent an error signal.
** A normal process receiving a non-normal error signal will die.
** A system process will convert the error signal to an error message and can receive it like any other message.
** A processes that terminates normally sends a normal error siognal to its link set.

* Error handling BIFs

** \verb+link(Pid)+ \verb+unlink(Pid)+
** \verb+process_flag(trap_exit, true)+
** \verb+spawn_link(Fun)+ \verb+spawn_link(M,F,A)+
** \verb+exit(Pid, Why)+ \verb+exit(Pid, kill)+

* Trapping exits
#+BEGIN_erlang
start() ->
    spawn_link(M, F, A) end.

start() ->
    process_flag(trap_exit, true),
    loop().

loop() ->
    receive
       {'EXIT', Pid, Why} ->
             ...
    end.
#+END_erlang

* A process that restarts a failed process
#+BEGIN_erlang
start_and_watch() ->
    Pid = spawn(f6, loop1, []),
    spawn(f6, watch, [Pid]),
    Pid.

watch(Pid) ->
    link(Pid),
    process_flag(trap_exit, true),
    print({watching, Pid}),
    receive
	{'EXIT', Pid, Why} ->
	    print({ohDear,Pid,crashed,because,Why})
    end.
#+END_erlang

* Running the watcher
#+BEGIN_shell
Pid2 = f6:start_and_watch().
{watching,<0.62.0>}
<0.62.0>
9> Pid2 ! {square,abc}.        
{ohDear,<0.62.0>,crashed,because,
        {badarith,[{f6,loop1,0,[{file,"f6.erl"},{line,21}]}]}}

=ERROR REPORT==== 31-Jan-2014::10:26:29 ===
Error in process <0.62.0> with exit value: 
  {badarith,[{f6,loop1,0,[{file,"f6.erl"},{line,21}]}]}

{square,abc}
#+END_shell

* Spawn and Link race conditions
#+BEGIN_erlang
start_and_watch() ->
    Pid = spawn(f6, loop1, []),
    spawn(f6, watch, [Pid]),
    Pid.

watch(Pid) ->
    link(Pid),
    process_flag(trap_exit, true),
    ...
#+END_erlang

** If you are very quick, loop1 might crash {\sl before} the watcher executes the \verb+link+ statement.
** That's why we have \verb+spawn_link+.

* Monitors

** One directional links.
** A monitor is like two links ``back to back''.

* The Worker/Manager model
** Workers do work. They crash if they cannot do what they are supposed to do.
** Managers detect the failure of workers and restart them.
** \verb+start_and_watch+ was a very simple Worker/Manager program.
** OTP has supervisors which generalises this idea.
** Akka (Java) is a clone of this idea.

* Generic Allocator
** Server links to clients and deallocates respources if the clients crash
#+BEGIN_erlang
loop(State) ->
  receive
    {From, Tag, {allocate, X}} ->
        {Resource, State1} = allocate(From, X, State),
        link(From),
        From ! {Tag, Resource},        
        loop(State1);
    ...

    {'EXIT', Pid, _} ->
        State1 = dealloc_resources_owned_by(Pid, State),
        loop(State1)
  end.
#+END_erlang

* Distributed Programming?
** Fun.
** World is distributed.
   
* Erlang distribution
** Needs only one new idea.
** \verb+spawn(Node, Mod, Func, Args)+.
** Remote Pids work just like local Pids.
** Can test on one machine, deploy on many.
* Nano twitter
#+BEGIN_erlang
start() ->
    register(twit, spawn(nano_twitter, watcher, [])).

watcher() ->
    receive
	Any ->
	    print({tweet, Any}),
	    watcher()
	after 5000 ->
		print(yawn),
		watcher()
	end.

connect() ->
    pong = net_adm:ping('twit@joe').

tweet(Msg) ->
    rpc:cast('twit@joe', erlang, send, [twit, Msg]).
#+END_erlang

* Running Nano Twitter

In one terminal:

#+BEGIN_shell
erl  -noshell -sname twit -s nano_twitter start
yawn
...
#+END_shell

Someplace else:

#+BEGIN_shell
$ erl -sname one
(one@joe)1> nano_twitter:connect().
pong
(one@joe)2> nano_twitter:tweet('hi joe').
true
#+END_shell

Back where you started:

#+BEGIN_shell
yawn
{tweet,'hi joe'}
#+END_shell

* Fun Exercise (1) 
** No credits.
** Extend \verb+nano_twitter+
** Work in pairs.
** Client on one machine.
** Same LAN.
** Server on a different machine

* Fun Exercise (2)
** No credits. 
** Server on a different machine with a different OS.
** On a WAN.

* Fun Exercise (3) 
** No credits.
** Get the entire class running.

* Fun Exercise (4)

** Credits. 
** \verb+$$$$+
** Quit school.
** Form a company.
** Connect the world togther.

* RTFM

** \verb+http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html+
** Designed for clusters in the same LAN not wide scale distribution.
** Cookie security.
** Great for tightly connected clusters in the samer administrative domain.
** Code distribution problem not solved (assumes same backend to fetch the code from) - originally all nodes read from a NFS file system.
   
* Next Week

** Doing it with sockets :-)

* Have fun
